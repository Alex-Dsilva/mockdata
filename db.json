        "content": "It’s a common issue, and about as frustrating as it gets. You’re being mindful of your food choices, avoiding junk, exercising regularly, and still you aren’t seeing the results you expect. Maybe you aren’t seeing any results at all! There’s nothing more discouraging than feeling like you’re doing everything right, only to be met with nothing to show for your effort. Fortunately, because I’ve seen this problem so often in my clients over the years, I’ve got two easy solutions to share with you. Make no mistake, if you are making healthy food choices and exercising, but still not seeing results, it means somewhere along the way you are eating more than you realize. It’s an easy mistake to make. I call them “invisible calories.” A handful of something here or a taste of something there. Maybe just a bite, a spoonful, or a taste. We eat these foods but don’t think they’re worth logging because, “it can’t be that much anyway.” The problem is that we’re often wrong. In one singular event this might be true, but often we allow ourselves to do this multiple times a day. It can add up fast. Here you’ll get the strategies I use with my clients to eliminate these invisible calories and start seeing results again. Track Everything I want to share a story about peanut butter. It’s delicious, but that’s not the whole story. I used to buy the large, 48oz family-size, jars of peanut butter. It’d take me about a week and a half to finish. (By myself, of course.)After a few weeks I was getting suspicious. I had been tracking my food as usual but not seeing the steady weight loss I would normally expect for the nutrition plan I was following. It seemed my weight wouldn’t budge. What gives? I decided to look back to figure out what was going on. (One of the benefits of food logging is having a record to look at later.) During this time I had developed a habit of using just the tip of a spoon to scoop some peanut butter for a little taste, every time I was passing through the kitchen. It seems harmless, right? I mean, how many calories can such a small amount of peanut butter really add to the grand scheme of my day or the week at large? The problem wasn’t the quantity in any particular spoon tasting, it was the frequency with which I participated in this new habit. It was happening throughout the day, multiple times, every day of the week. In a 48oz jar of peanut butter there are 32 servings (2 tbsp), with each serving containing 190 calories. After reviewing my food logs over the lifespan of one of these jars, I found that I had only logged twelve of these servings. “Officially,” I had only consumed twelve servings, but the jar was clearly gone. That means I consumed an extra twenty servings of peanut butter that had become “invisible calories,” calories I was eating that failed to be accounted for. Over the course of a week that’s an extra 3,800 calories, almost two full days worth, without even realizing it. This is why tracking everything, no matter how small, is important for ensuring you aren’t actually eating more than you realize. (It’s an easy thing to do.) Foods will often surprise you with how many calories they contain, and keeping a log will help you identify whether your “harmless handfuls” are actually holding you back. Here’s another example: I have a client who had gotten relaxed about her logging. Admittedly, she’d been tracking for awhile and has a pretty goodgrasp on the calorie content of most things she eats. Yet, she wasn’t seeing any progress and didn’t know why. I encouraged her to sit down and track everything she ate at a recent dinner party she had attended. She ate well: a small piece of steak, minimal potatoes, lots of veggies, and limited herself to not more than two beers. She even fasted that day so she had extra calories to spend. She was convinced everything was going to be under her goal for the day. After sitting down and tracking everything, she realized each beer had 250 calories and drinking two meant a third of her calories were already gone. The steak wasn’t the leanest cut, that took up another third. She had a few “cheesy bites” before dinner, and three of those had a whopping 140 calories. In the end, her one meal of the day put her over her daily goal. Imagine how far over she’d have been if she had eaten regular meals before this? It is incredibly easy to over-consume food, even healthy food. Tracking everything you eat diligently is a key habit in order to avoid invisible calories halting your progress. Here a two quick tips for logging: 1) Log before you take your first bite. This way it’s done and you can accurately track the portions while you’re looking at them. 2) Err on the side of over-logging calories. If you estimate more than you actually eat, you’ll definitely fall within your calorie goal. Underestimating will send you over, quick. Buy A Food Scale To illustrate the power of weighing your food, let me tell you a story about oatmeal. (A healthy food, right?) I love oatmeal, especially overnight oats, and I eat it almost daily. For those who are unfamiliar, a serving of oatmeal is 150 calories for a 1/2 cup serving—forty grams worth of oats. I would usually eat two servings at atime (sometimes twice a day), and would use a measuring cup to make sure I was accurate. Hey, I was tracking it, right? I ran into the same problem as before, hard work and diligent tracking but little or no results. I was even being sure I was good about tracking everything. Still no results! I decided to buy a food scale one day to help increase the accuracy of my tracking. While I bought it primarily for meat (it’s hard to fit in a measuring cup), I was curious how accurate my “1/2 cup” servings of oats actually were. So I compared. I placed an empty bowl on the food scale and poured in my 1/2 cup serving of oats. (Remember, this should have come out to forty grams.) The scale said sixty grams! That is 50% more oats than I intended, masked as a single serving. This happened because, like many people, when I use a measuring cup I turn it into a “bag sale”—everything you can fit in the bag at one low price. I assumed if it was a 1/2 cup per serving, that meant whatever I could possibly fit in the measuring cup counted as one serving. (Let’s just say it was a very rounded scoop, not a level scoop.) Making this mistake twice per day meant that I was consuming an extra serving of oats without realizing it; another 150 of these invisible calories. That adds up to an extra 1,050 calories across one week! I’ll tell you another story about one of my clients, whom we recently ran into this problem with. He was making good food choices, great food choices actually, but still seeing minimal progress. I encouraged him to invest in a food scale. (I say invest, but they’re super cheap.) He was regularly eating salmon for dinner, and was logging one filet of salmon at around 300 calories. Nothing out of the ordinary here, that’s within the ballpark for something like this. He might have two of those for dinner.Then we had him weigh the salmon. Sure, he was eating one filet, that filet just happen to weigh close to one pound! You bet he was satisfied after that meal, but he was also eating over 1,000 calories per filet, and sometimes he’d have two! That is almost an entire day’s worth of calories that is being overlooked. It’s a miracle he wasn’t gaining any weight, let alone losing any. If you’re tracking diligently, but still not seeing the results you want, I would definitely get a food scale and start weighing everything you eat. This will increase the accuracy of your logs and help prevent any incidents of these invisible calories. Here are two food scale tips: 1) Weigh in grams as much as possible. It’ll be more accurate, and just about everything has a gram measurement for servings. 2) All nutrition labels show a serving size in both volume (cups, oz, etc.) and weight (grams) measurements. The weight will always be in parentheses. 3) You don’t need to spend more than $20 on a food scale. If you feel discouraged because you’ve been doing everything right, are doing it consistently, and still aren’t seeing results, then I urge you to follow my advice using the above strategies. Remember, if you aren’t losing weight you are eating too much. These strategies can help you figure out where that’s happening",

        "title": "7 Habits to Lose Weight with any Diet",
        "author": "Jane Smith",
        "summary": "Sustainable habits beat diets for weight loss. Prioritize balance, flexibility, and mindfulness. Choose a lasting approach, not temporary changes. Focus on portion sizes and food choices without self-punishment. Long-term success trumps short-term fixes.",
        "content": "When it comes to weight loss, the concern of most people is trying to select the most effective diet. No doubt some diets are more recommendable than others, but in the long term the results depend more on habits than on specific diets. If you see change as something temporary, you will surely fail. When you go back to your usual habits, the usual kilos will come back, plus some extra. You must of course choose a good eating plan, but then focus on the new habits to develop. In this article you will learn about the habits that are usually associated with long-term success, and concrete ideas for incorporating them. 1. Allow some flexibility (Flexible Control). Very restrictive diets are difficult to maintain over time. Eliminating foods you enjoy forever reduces adherence by requiring too much willpower. In addition, we want more of what we can't have, and this rigid control raises the risk of cravings (study) and possibly binge eating. On the other hand, excessive flexibility is also negative. To achieve certain goals you must make certain sacrifices, and that means setting limits for yourself. That ideal balance point is what some studies call flexible control, which will vary from person to person. Maintaining flexible control involves paying attention to food and following certain guidelines, but understanding that your progress doesn't stop because you have your favorite pizza for dinner one day. It's about prioritizing real food and being mindful of portions, without self-punishing or blaming yourself if one day you overeat or eat something undesirable. While this flexible control facilitates the maintenance of lost weight, rigid control is associated with worse long-term results. In addition, rigid control can lead to a dangerous obsession with achieving a supposed dietary purity. When you fail in this impossible mission, you break down, worsening your results. Avoid the all-or-nothing mentality. Seek progress, not perfection. 2. Reduce snacks The belief that we should eat five or six meals a day is a recent one. In the 1970s most people ate three large meals a day, but this number increased over time.On the one hand, nutritional recommendations leaned toward smaller meals, thinking that this would better control hunger and keep metabolism high (both ideas are wrong). On the other hand, the food industry increased its promotion of mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks. They knew that if we increase the number of daily intakes we will tend to eat more, and big stomachs are more profitable than small ones. Thus, the average number of meals increased from the typical three meals a day just a few decades ago to the current five or six. Calories from snacks have increased in all age ranges, contributing to the current caloric excess Snacks are adding more and more calories. 3. Cook more and eat out less Cooking is one of the best skills you can develop. It's not about elaborating sophisticated dishes, but about defending yourself with the basics. In the time Master Chef lasts, you can prepare food for several days. You will also avoid exposing yourself to their misleading propaganda. Cooking more at home and eating less in restaurants are habits that are associated with less weight gain . When cooking you have much more control over your meals, both their size and their ingredients. You will certainly use better oils and lower calorie sauces. If you eat out often, try to follow some rules: 1. Tell them not to put bread or snacks on the table. 2. If you order salad, have them serve the sauce on the side, or simply add oil and vinegar. 3. Ask them to swap undesirable side dishes (such as chips) for some salad. 4. You don't have to eat everything on your plate. Eating more than you need is also wasting food, and you will carry the excess with you in the form of fat. Besides, in most restaurants you can take the leftovers with you. 5. Skip dessert, or just order a piece of fruit. 4. Reconnect with your body's signals If you have followed a strict diet, for example a ketogenic or PSMF approach, you have probably had to count calories and macronutrients. This has benefits and I recommend doing it for a while, but if you do it consistently you raise the risk of disconnecting from your body. Once you are at your ideal weight, you must learn to reconnect with your body's internal signals, stopping eating when you are satisfied, without becoming full. This is precisely what is recommended by the millenary Japanese technique of Hara hachi bu, or 80% belly. The goal is for your body, not your phone, to tell you when to stop eating. To achieve this, you must be more conscious when eating, and this is precisely the following recommendation. 5. Be more conscious when eating We make more than 200 food decisions a day, most of them unconscious (detail). If you don't think about what you eat and don't control your portions, you will be at the mercy of your impulses and easily manipulated by commercial interests. In fact, this process of awareness should begin long before you sit down at the table. When you go shopping, take a list with you. Don't buy anything that is not on the list if you don't need it, even if it is on sale. Refuse free samples. At mealtime, chew calmly and pay attention ,avoiding eating in front of the TV or in the presence of any other distraction (like checking Instagram). Eat the allotted portion and do not repeat, unless you are really hungry. Don't eat directly from the fridge or packaging. Take out the portion, serve it on a plate and save the rest. In short, it's about becoming more aware of the choices you make around food, and that increased awareness will improve your behavior (meta-analysis).Remind yourself often why you do this. Aligning your behavior with your values improves your ability to self-regulate, tolerate uncomfortable feelings, and become more aware of your decisions. 6. Weigh yourself frequently I know this recommendation is not very popular, but the evidence is clear. People who weigh themselves frequently lose more weight and regain less weight. People who weigh themselves more frequently lose more weight. Some believe that weighing can generate anxiety, but the evidence does not seem to support this idea. And if this were to happen, it would not be the fault of the scale, but of our relationship with weight. To begin with, you must understand that weight fluctuations are normal, and that your progress is measured by many other variables (measurements, muscle, performance, energy level...). Furthermore, if you gain two kilos of muscle and lose two kilos of fat, your body will look much better, even though your weight has not undergone any variation. But all this does not imply that you should ignore weight, but understand it and put it in context. And above all, you should avoid linking your personal worth to the value indicated by the scale. If you allow your weight to define you, stopping weighing yourself does not solve the problem. Another benefit of weighing yourself frequently is that you see the trend more clearly, avoiding that punctual fluctuations make you make wrong decisions. Don't obsess about your weight, but don't ignore it either. 7. Include physical activity Increasing physical activity, especially strength training, will not only enhance the results of the diet, but is one of the habits most strongly associated with long-term weight maintenance. Exercise benefits us by multiple mechanisms: 1. It helps regulate appetite. 2. It improves insulin sensitivity. 3. It raises metabolism, especially strength training. 4. Increases energy expenditure. 5. It improves our mood. Summary and conclusions All happy families resemble each other, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way - Leo Tolstoy (Anna Karenina). The so-called Anna Karenina principle indicates that success requires the presence of many specific factors, while failure can be explained by the lack of any one of them. Success is therefore a much more fragile state, since in the absence of certain conditions it will result in chaos.",

        "title": "10 Causes You Don't Lose Weight",
        "author": "Jhon Cook",
        "summary": "Weight loss plateaus are frustrating. 10 reasons for not losing weight: weight fluctuations, underestimating calories, processed foods, low protein, weekend indulgence, poor sleep, prolonged dieting, lack of exercise, imbalanced gut, medication side effects.",
        "content": "Getting stuck in weight loss is frustrating, but these plateaus are also learning opportunities. Below I summarize 10 common reasons why you don't lose weight and some practical ideas for overcoming them. 1. You are losing weight but you don't realize it Your weight fluctuates from day to day due to a multitude of factors: hydration level, glycogen, stomach contents, fluid retention, menstrual cycle... If you weigh yourself once a week and don't see any variation, you might think that you haven't lost anything. To improve monitoring I recommend weighing yourself daily and calculating the average weight for the week. Comparing the weekly average will smooth out the daily fluctuations and you will be able to see the real progress. Evaluating progress by weekly average weight avoids being misled by daily fluctuations. This is especially relevant after the rapid losses of the first few weeks. Also, if you are strength training (and you should be), you will gain muscle mass. This will help you burn more fat, but the total weight loss will be less.If you lose two kilos of fat and gain one kilo of muscle the scale will only reflect a total weight loss of 1 kilo, although this is very good progress. However, someone who does not strength train may lose two kilos of fat and one kilo of muscle. Looking at the scales, he or she would be very happy (3 kilos less!), even though it is a much worse result. Also remember that weight is just one more metric of progress, not necessarily the main one. Another example: if you start supplementing with creatine it is normal to gain 1-2 kg in a short time, but it is not fat, just water. 2. You eat more than you think Most people underestimate the calories they eat, and the difference is especially large in the most overweight people. Many studies note deviations of 20-50%. We are clearly unaware of this error, because we continue to underreport calories even though we know they will be verified later (study) or even though we are paid to improve accuracy (study). We are very easily fooled. Even dietitians underestimate their calories by 10%. That's less than half that of the rest of the population, but it's still a big enough error to produce stagnation. What are the most frequent calculation errors? - We underestimate portions. What looks like 100 grams of rice to us is actually 150. - We remember the foods that make us look good (spinach and kale) but tend to forget those we are less proud of (like donuts). - We count the hundred calories in the salad but not the three hundred in the dressing. - We log the coffee but not the three tablespoons of coconut oil and butter (which is why I don't recommend bulletproof coffee). - We don't count liquid calories. Our satiety-signaling mechanisms are little influenced by liquid calories, so it's best to reduce them. - We don't consider the small snacks we take during the day. - How to minimize this mistake? Buy a weight like this one and record for a week everything you eat, with apps like myfitnesspal or FatSecret. 3. You don't base your diet on real food. Calories matter, but so does their origin. Real food (minimally processed fresh food) has many benefits over more processed foods: It is more satiating, and thus facilitates calorie control. It requires more energy to digest, which reduces the calories that are ultimately absorbed. It is more nutritionally dense, and micronutrients also participate in the satiety signal. The result is that by basing food on real food, weight loss is more easily achieved (study). Diets based on fresh foods facilitate weight loss, those based on ultra-processed foods promote the opposite. 4. You don't eat enough protein Protein-rich diets improve body composition in several ways: They increase satiety. Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. They increase thermogenesis. Some 20-30% of protein calories are expended in their own digestion, making it difficult to ultimately be stored as fat. They minimize muscle loss. Or even facilitate muscle gain if the diet is accompanied by strength training. What level of protein is ideal for weight loss? Between 1.5 and 2 grams per kg of weight per day. 5. You relax too much on the weekend Many people do well with their diet during the week but relax too much on the weekend. There is no problem in including days with more calories (and we will see that it even has benefits), but if you increase the consumption of alcohol and ultra-processed foods from Friday to Sunday (in addition to reducing physical activity) you will ruin all the progress of the week. 6. You do not sleep well (or enough) Sleep deficit damages metabolism by multiple mechanisms . It makes us lose insulin sensitivity, reduces anabolic hormones and increases hunger. We also become more impulsive and find it difficult to control our appetite. If you want to lose weight, pay attention to sleep. 7. You have been dieting for a long time If you have a lot of fat to lose you must spend months in caloric deficit, and your body interprets that as a threat. Its defense strategy is to slow down metabolism and reduce energy expenditure. In extreme cases it disables entire systems, such as the reproductive system.The result is that losing weight becomes increasingly difficult, and continuing to drop calories only makes the problem worse. After a certain point you should start to include reloads or even whole weeks of rest, where you return to your maintenance calories. This way you reverse the metabolic adaptations that slow down your progress and restart your weight loss, as well as allowing you a psychological respite. Paradoxically, eating more will help you lose weight. 8. You move not enough Losing weight through diet alone is possible, but not recommended. For starters, you will lose more muscle mass, damaging your aesthetics and your health. In addition, after a certain point, cutting more calories will become too hard, and will only increase your appetite and frustration. Adding physical activity is the solution. When thinking about energy expenditure we tend to focus on the workout, ignoring the rest of the movement. However, all that low-intensity movement we do throughout the day, called NEAT or Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis, is often what determines whether you lose fat or plateau. Between two people of similar size there can be variations of up to 2,000 calories per day far more than what is possible to achieve in the hour we spend training. By moving more you will be able to eat more while still losing weight, the dietary holy grail. Technically we call this effect high energy flow, which makes the process much more bearable. 9. Your microbiota is altered Our bacteria influence countless metabolic processes, many of them associated with weight regulation. For example, butyrate produced by your bacteria in the colon reduces appetite and improves metabolism (detail, detail).A poor microbiota promotes overweight. The type of bacteria you have (and their balance) influences your appetite for some foods or others, the amount of calories you absorb from food, the production of butyrate, your level of inflammation... and all these factors determine how easy it is for you to lose weight. Including the right food for your bacteria will help you lose weight. 10. Taking medications All medications have side effects, including, in some cases, weight gain. It is more difficult to lose weight with many types of antidepressants, glucocorticoids and beta-blockers. Prolonged consumption of antibiotics is also associated with more overweight, due to its negative effect on the microbiota. Obviously you should take the medications you need, but be aware of their possible effects.",
